The need for clean water is not only limited to humans but also extends to all living things as a naturally occurring component for life continuity on planet Earth. Water quality monitoring is important for guiding safety management and ensuring public health. With a global estimate of 7 billion dreams, many of whom still lack access to quality drinking water, it’s important to share knowledge and information all around the world to break the vicious cycle of ignorance and water wastage. With expatriate estimates of water project costs, this shall reduce failure of building water safety capacity.

## Short description
CWIoT is an IoT and AI enabled remote water resources monitoring application using geospatial mapping, water quality data and chat-bot recommender.

### The problem

According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news/item/18-06-2019-1-in-3-people-globally-do-not-have-access-to-safe-drinking-water-unicef-who), 2.2 billion people around the world do not have safely managed drinking water services, 4.2 billion people do not have safely managed sanitation services, and 3 billion people lack basic handwashing facilities. These services are critical in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and other diseases. Even in areas that have these services, there are vast inequalities in the accessibility, availability, and quality of the services. 

UNICEF is urgently appealing for funding and support to reach more children with basic water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities, especially those children who are cut off from safe water because they live in remote areas, in places where water is untreated or polluted, or because they are without a home, living in a slum or on the street.

The need for clean water is not only limited to humans but also extends to all living things as a naturally occurring component for life continuity on planet Earth. Water quality monitoring is important for guiding safety management and ensuring public health. With a global estimate of 7 billion dreams, many of whom still lack access to quality drinking water, it’s important to share knowledge and information all around the world to break the vicious cycle of ignorance and water wastage. With expatriate estimates of water project costs, this shall reduce failure of building water safety capacity.

i) Geospatial mapping data

Geographic Information System(GIS) as modern tool for collecting, storing, managing,
applying and analyzing geographic information, can realize effective management of spatial information and other kinds of information. Using the powerful spatial information processing capabilities of GIS, all the inquiry and analysis results can be visualized in the form of map, text, chart and multimedia.
Use Cases:
User can monitor nearby water bodies.
He/she can check routes to transport water from water rich to water scarce areas.


ii) Water Pollutants data monitoring

We are using IoT sensors which can monitor water quality data and transmit in real-time to the cloud application. Each kind of monitoring data that reflect the water pollution, such as name of the river, monitoring place, monitoring time, solid suspension, dissolved oxygen, temperature, content of phosphorus and mercury and so on. In addition to this, the data of population, geographic name etc. can be added.

iii) ChatBot

This will be based on IBM Watson Chatbot API which can answer basic queries related with water usage conservation, low cost filtration options and cost estimation for water construction projects. Future integration will be speech to text and local language support
